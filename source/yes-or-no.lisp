Does not beep anymore. The rationale for no-beep policy is: all the
prompts that user responds to are equally important (because these
won't be prompts if they weren't important). Some of these prompts are
urgent, but attracting user attention is not guaranteed to solve the
urgency anywayâ€”one might ignore the beeps altogether.

If you want beeps, though, you can always define a :before/:around
method that beeps as much as you want it to :)
