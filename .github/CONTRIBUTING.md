# Contributing, branch management, and code style

I'll be glad to accept implementation support patches, bug reports,
and ideas for further evolution for Graven Image. And other types of
things that don't fit the former categories!

See the Roadmap section in the README.org for the ideas on what you
can start from.

If you submit a patch, make sure to follow one of the style guides for
Lisp, such as [Norvig & Pitman's Tutorial on Good Lisp Programming
Style
(PDF)](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~nau/cmsc421/norvig-lisp-style.pdf) or
[Google Common Lisp Style
Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/lispguide.xml). Would be
nice if you split all atomic changes into separate commits, and,
preferably, split big disjoint changes into separate pull requests.
